Various folders and files here had these 2 kinds of license, but since first one is "more to the point", I decided to include both of them under this 1 "readme.txt" file, for the sake of convenience. Some files were modified, such as specular maps, either way, I respected Nobiax's license, and all credit goes to him. - Morti
