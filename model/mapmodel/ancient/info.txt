Only Wavefront (.obj) and configuration (.cfg) files in these folders/subfolders are copyrighted. If you want to modify them in any way, please keep your changes for yourself, don't share them in any form in any medium... It'll be most appreciated, thank you.

These models were created from scratch in Blender 2.79, exported to Wavefront format (.obj), and use textures legaly downloaded from "textures.com". Some used textures have been modified in GIMP 2.8, and/or ImageMagick. They are made with only my Valhalla maps in mind, but if other mappers can reuse them in their maps, they are most welcome to do so. However, I would appreciate if you didn't use these models outside of Valhalla, about the textures, you can do anything with them.

To clear any possible misunderstanding, I'm mapper for several Cube GE based games, and I have habit of using different name for each game I play, both online and offline. In Sauerbraten my name is 7YearBitch (grunge band from Seattle), in Tesseract it's Suiseiseki (character from Rozenmaiden), in Valhalla it's Morti (character from .hack// light novels). There are other less known names as Kasadya and Rapedoll, but that's about it. I'm sokky for inconvenience... :)

Cheers, Morti
