Concrete Pour V0.6 by Pritchard - 13/8/14

A 1v1 or 2v2 map that I whipped up to help get my mind off of another map i've been working on that's been driving me nuts.
The layout is pretty complete at this stage, but I still want to add more detail in future versions. 

Changes:
V0.6: Clipping and decal added.
V0.5: Initial Release

To install the map and its resources on Windows, extract the media folder to:

C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\My Games\Tesseract
