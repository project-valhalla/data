Deathmatch map for 4-6 players. It has 2 ports and 4 jpads, with some "hard-to-reach" areas for camping.
It's layout (expecially bottom part) is somewhat similar to Academy from Sauer, but it's changed and upgraded.
I've edited Philip's 'pk02' texture pack, but it's really compact, and you can use it, I respected his license.
